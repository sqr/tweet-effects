# Tweet Effects
The aim of this project is to download tweet data for bulk processing in After Effects, auto generating and populating compositions. It is divided in two parts:
* **tweet_effects.py**: Python program that prompts the user to input the URL of a tweet. It then downloads its data to a JSON file, as well as the avatar of the user that posted the tweet to a JPEG file. Both files are downloaded. 
* **tweet_effects.jsx**: After Effects script that fetches the downloaded files, imports them all into the project, generates appropiate folder structure and matching compositions based on the template composition in the included After Effects project.
